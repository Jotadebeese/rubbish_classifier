# Rubbish Classifier

Hi, my name is Juan, and I am getting into AI, **deep Learning** to be more specific. 

Therefore I have been taking a free course about **PyTorch** available on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A&t=18s and https://www.learnpytorch.io/ from Daniel Bourke. 

This repository is one of the projects inside the course, where the idea is to build a Computer Vision Neural Network using the **TinyVGG** model class from https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/ to make predictions on three kinds of food: sushi, Steak and Pizza.

To make it more exciting and obtain more significant learning, I used my data and changed from food to rubbish, where I made predictions on **takeaway coffee cups**, **glass bottles**, and **milk/juice boxes**. 

It is a simple neural network to test my knowledge and what I have learned. The idea is to continue and eventually publish a working web app on my portfolio https://jotadebeese.me/, including around ten classes (kind of rubbish) where other people can upload their images and obtain a prediction. 

To do so, I will continue my learning journey and, in the future improve the model to make it more accurate.
